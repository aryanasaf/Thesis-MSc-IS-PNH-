# Thesis-MSc-IS-PNH-
This is the repository for all the code, files, and useful material for my Master's thesis at Province North Holland. This repository is private because the code and data are confidential for the Province North Holland.

This repository consists of multiple files. Below, the files and their content are listed.

## Notebook EDA final 1 
This is the first EDA as described in the Methodology section of the thesis report (section 3.3). This file contains the EDA steps after the merge (the merge was conducted within Dataiku, which has a built-in join function when uploading datasets). In this file, you can see how I dealt with missing values, categorical variables, outliers, how I constructed the target variable, and how I investigated the interaction and relationship between variables. 
## Notebook EDA final 2 
In this file, additional datasets have been added to the final dataset from the first EDA file. This file updates the last plots in regard to the new dataset. The final dataset used in the research is the dataset that comes out of this file.
## Notebook models final
This file contains the code as described in the experimental setup in the thesis report (section 3.4). The pipeline and the results of the training set and test set are shown in this notebook for all the models and different sampling techniques. 
## Notebook models final 2
This file contains mostly the same output as the first final models file, but this file also contains plots derived from the best model and the baseline models for each rebalancing technique.
